#### What is a data center?&#x20;

* a building with powerful computers used to run a company\`s services&#x20;

#### &#x20;Hyperscale data centers

* made up of tens of thousands of servers, process big data, support cloud computing and serve billions of users for services like Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Search, and Google Cloud&#x20;
